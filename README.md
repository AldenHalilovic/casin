# Project Title

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Structure

- `pages/`: This directory contains all the pages of your application. Each file corresponds to a route based on its name.
- `public/`: This directory is used to serve static assets such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.
- `styles/`: This directory contains global styles.
- `components/`: This directory contains reusable React components.
- `api/`: This directory is used for creating API routes.

## Key Implementation Details

- This project uses Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- It is bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, which sets up a default Next.js app with everything you need to get started.
- The project uses `next/font` for automatic font optimization. This feature automatically inlines font CSS and loads fonts in a non-render blocking way.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
